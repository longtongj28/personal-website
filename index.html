                        <li>Designed and managed front-end application state through several components (React)</li>
                        <li>Designed and implemented the REST API with the CRUD operations that allowed communication with MongoDB, my database provider (Node.js, Express, and Postman)</li>
                        <li>
                            The structural model for the data was this:<br/>User->Courses->Course Categories->Category Assignments<br/>

                        <li>
                            I had several challenges with the data that were fixed by carrying the item key/ID from higher levels of data to lower levels, which helped me implement delete and put requests.

                            I needed a provider to deploy my website, since it's not a typical static website. I chose Heroku for that, and learned how to integrate the necessary heroku scripts into my own applications build script.

                        <li>
                            Reflections: <br/>I would use React Redux for global application state rather than managing and passing through components.<br/>
                            It also would have been a better idea to design the entire structural model for the data before implementing it.

                    <li> Meet MATLAB Battleship, a terminal game that was deceptively difficult to make.</li>
                    <li> User input verification was the biggest challenge. My group members helped me by testing the game continuously and reporting errors to me.</li>
                    <li> Non-valid inputs were taken into consideration in designing the game.</li>
                    <li> For example, placing ships on top of each other or outside the board prompts the user again.</li>
                    <li> The next most challenging part was the single player AI. There are two difficulties here, easy and hard.</li>
                    <li>The easy difficulty simply guesses random areas on the board. I had a lot of fun figuring out what the hard difficulty meant. <br/>
                            Eventually, I made a simple algorithm for the computer to keep guessing until it hits a ship. If it does, then search around that hit. </li>

                <p>I also enjoy haircutting on the side. I cut my Dad and my two brother's hair at home, and that became a pretty common occurrence during quarantine 😀. <br/>I like to think I am getting pretty decent, as my clients are pretty satisfied. Unfortunately, I can't cut my own hair, but I hope I can do that one day. </p>

                <p>Another thing I like to do is help my parents cook, because I know I inevitably will be living on my own. By far my favorite thing to cook is dumplings and potstickers, although I enjoy dumplings more (hint: they are boiled).</p>

                <p>And of course, who doesn't like to play video games. I used to play StarCraft 2 (Protoss), where I actually got into the top 200 Grandmaster ranking for. I loved this RTS game, but since college, I've stopped playing it. I currently play League of Legends, although I am on the verge of quitting that as well (I am not Grandmaster in that game, only Silver 😂).</p>

                <p>I'm of Chinese descent, and I've made it my goal to fluently learn Mandarin and maybe even my parents' Chinese dialects. Because of this, I'm also interested in learning other languages used in my community.</p>
                <p>我的中文有点s**t 哈哈，我尽量去进步💪</p>
                <p>I like listening to R&B music, or anything that's chill and relaxing really. I've recently been getting myself to listen to more Chinese music of the same musical category to work towards my language goal, which I've been enjoying so far. My nine year old brother has been learning guitar recently, and I'm learning along with him, although I am very focused on programming right now 🖥️. </p>
